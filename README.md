# Drug Discovery with Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and resources used in my thesis on drug discovery using machine learning. The project leverages cheminformatics tools and deep learning models to identify and predict potential drug candidates.

## Overview
The notebook includes:
- **Data Preparation**: Tools and methods for processing molecular datasets. Data preprocessing for normalization, enumeration etc, had already be done in previous notebook.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of machine learning algorithms, including LSTM neural networks, for predictive modeling.
- **Analysis and Results**: Evaluation of model performance and insights into the findings.


## Prerequisites
To run the code in this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow
- RDKit (for cheminformatics)

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Drug_Discovery_script.ipynb
   ```
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Set up the environment
   - Process the molecular data
   - Train and evaluate the predictive models


## Key Technologies
- **RDKit**: For molecular representation and cheminformatics tasks.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training machine learning models.
- **scikit-learn**: For data preprocessing and model evaluation.

## Results
The project demonstrates the application of LSTM-based neural networks to predict molecular properties and identify promising drug candidates. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
